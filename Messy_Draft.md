# Abstract

Technical documentation is boring. It's boring to plan, it's boring to create, and it's especially boring to read. But, technical documentation is also an incredibly important resource for users and developers of digital libraries. This is especially true of large scale digital library initiatives that offer application programming interfaces (APIs) for accessing large collections of digital artifacts. In this paper we propose evaluation criteria for APIs. 

## Introduction

It may seem trite to observe the profound effect that large-scale digital library initiatives have had on the access, and use of of cultural heritage artifacts; but, it shouldn't. Initiatives such as Europeana, the Hathi Trust, and the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) have created collections of diverse digital materials that make new forms of scholarship, and new modes of cultural understanding possible. Perhaps most profoundly, these new aggregations of resources are allowing the digital humanities to flourish - realizing the potential of not only a 'Renaissance' view of great ideas, but also a pragmatic view of ourselves and the role of the arts in our public lives (Adams, 2014). Consider the following examples: 

- In his revelatory work on income inequality the french economist Thomas Piketty claimed that the 19th and 20th century novel was a mirror. Not content to take this assertion at face value, Underwood et al. showed that in fact, fiscal language became more pronounced during this time period (2014)

These examples are not subtle shifts in scholarship - they represent paradigmatic new ways of knowing, and they simultaneously require new approaches to traditional concepts in digital library development, such as the scholarly collection (), accessibility (), intellectual property rights (), and evaluation criteria (Feinberg, )

In this paper, we focus on documentation of application programming interfaces (APIs) as      



### Why does documentation matter? 

Complete and timely technical documentation has been show to be the leading indicator of trust between developers and users of open-source software (Dagenais & Robillar, 2010). 

There is a long history of studying technical documentation in terms of its understandability, and its effectiveness for end users. 

There are two points to be made - one utilitarian, and the other economic: 

    Utilitarian 


    Economic 

As early as the 1970s economic studies of technical documentation were being conducted - finding that improved technical documentation could save the government $1.7 million (Shriver and Hart, 1975). 


Q & A sites, development blogs, and social media also play an important role in supplementing existing documentation - in some cases - offering high levels of coverage and author engagement (Parnin and Treude, 2011). A distinction can be made between the types of documentation we've described thus far: 

- *creator documentaiton*

- *communnity documentation*, such as wikis used by open source projects, allow anyone involved with the creation or use of a resource to contribute to documentation about the resource. 

- *crowd documentation*, such as developer blogs and Q and A, are individual contributions that often focus on documenting a single aspect of the resource. In aggregate, crowd documentation has proven to be rich in both coverage and quality [2011]

Our focus is on documentation for application programming interfaces (APIs) in digital libraries. 

## WHAT ARE APIs AND WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT 

APIs are thus an important aspect of end-user interactions with a digital library. API's, and technical documentation more generally, are not part of the evaluation process for digital library development. This paper seeks to fill this gap in two ways: 

1. Provide a background to API usability, documentation, and evaluation from software industry. 
2. Propose a metric which quantifies Th.3. e coverage and completeness of API documentation, both formal and informal. 
3. Evaluate five large-scale digital library APIs based on these criteria. 


# Background on documentation, API usability

In a field study of 440 software engineers, R + D find that the biggest obstacle to learning APIs is poor documentation and insufficient learning resources. They recommend the following criteria for improving documentation: **documentation of intent; code examples; matching APIs with scenarios; penetrability of the API; and format and presentation**. (Robillard and Deline, 2011)
